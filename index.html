          <h2>Social, Riding</h2>
          <p>
            All are welcome on our fun, social rides. We ride at the pace of the
            slowest, and pause regularly at the top of big hills to give
            everyone a chance to get their breath back (faster folks, bring a
            jacket so you don't chill off!).
          </p>
          <p>
            We always have at least one cafe stop thanks to our club sponser

              <strong>31st October, 11pm :</strong> Halloween 'Midnight Special'
              Beerienteering.
              <strong>Over 18's Only!</strong>

              <p>A truly special event put on by club secretery, C-Grizzle.</p>
              <p>
                You are given a list of spooky waymark sites (ruins, cemetaries
                etc) and thanks to local brewery sponsers there'll be a
                different beer to collect from a semi secret location just
                outside the waymarks. For every different (still sealed and
                full) beer you bring back to event HQ, you'll get points. Most
                points wins a special prize (tbc).
              </p>
              <p><strong>PS</strong> You get to keep the beer!</p>

              All are welcome, but it'll be 62.2miles! Why? It's the metric
              century of 100km, that's why.
