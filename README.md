# Codecademy Challenge Project: Responsive Club Website

### Overview

​This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the Internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.​

### Project Goals

In this project, you’ll be building your own club group page that will dynamically respond as you adjust the size of your screen!​

In this project, you’ll build a webpage for a local club. You can base it on real-life organization you belong to or make one up! You’ll get to choose everything about your page: the club name, the page layout and styling, any images that you want to use, and more! You can check out our example site for some inspiration and experiment with what elements are responsive. We’ll provide the full code for this site in the solution section at the end of this project.
